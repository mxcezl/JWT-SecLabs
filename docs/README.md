# Welcome to the Docs! 📚

This folder contains the guides and detailed walkthroughs for each lab in the JWT Hacking Lab.

Here's a quick directory to help you navigate:

1. **[Secrets Under the Rug: Exploiting Weak HMAC Secrets](1-SECRETS-UNDER-THE-RUG.md)** 🤫: Your journey starts here! Learn how low-complexity secrets can lead to vulnerabilities in HMAC-signed JWTs.

2. **Voiding the Rules: None Algorithm Exploitation (CVE-2015-9235)** 🚫: Not yet developed. Stay tuned to practice exploiting the none algorithm vulnerability, which can lead to token verification bypass.

3. **Chameleon Hashes: Changing Hash from Asymmetric to Symmetric (CVE-2016-5431/CVE-2016-10555)** 🔀: Coming soon. This lab will provide a deeper understanding of the potential pitfalls in hash algorithms and how to exploit them.

4. **Breaking and Entering Keys: Injecting a New Public Key in the Header (CVE-2018-0114)** 🔑: Under development. Here, you'll soon explore how attackers can insert a new public key into the header to manipulate token verification.

5. **Hidden Keys, Open Doors: Exploiting Embedded Public Keys (CVE-2018-0114)** 👁️: In progress. Learn about the vulnerabilities that arise when public keys are embedded in tokens.

6. **ID Missteps: Exploring Bad JWT ID (JTI) Implementation in Backend** 🆔: Development to be started soon. Learn how missteps in JTI implementation can open the door for exploitation.

As we continue to develop more labs, this directory will grow. Each lab guide will provide a detailed scenario description, step-by-step instructions, and expected results to help you understand and exploit various JWT vulnerabilities. 🛠️

Remember, the goal here is to educate about potential JWT vulnerabilities so we can build more secure systems. Please do not use this knowledge for malicious purposes. 🙏

Happy Hacking! 💻 🎉
